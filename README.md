Murphy's Revenge (and Infotron!)
================================

Many moons ago, while they were still in High School, [@dangerdave](http://davepeck.org/), [@dsandler](http://dsandler.org), [Nate Cook](http://natecook.com/), and Brooke Nelson set forth to write a video game.

That game was **Infotron!** and it was released in 1994 for the Macintosh. Infotron was based on a PC game called [Supaplex](http://www.elmerproductions.com/sp/).

After Infotron was finished, attention was turned to **Murphy's Revenge** -- a planned sequel with smooth scrolling and better graphics. Alas, we went to college and got distracted; Murphy's Revenge was never finished.

What's This?
------------

This repository is our homage to these over 17-year-old games. It's our way of letting go and setting them free.

Here's what you'll find:

- In `legacy/infotron` you'll find the source code, data files, 1994 web site, and release archives for Infotron! Infotron was our first large-scale software effort. We wrote it in Pascal, and with the perspective of 17 years I think it is safe to say that we had no idea what we were doing! :-) The data files are old-style MacOS resource files.

- In `legacy/murphy` you'll find a lot of random stuff for Murphy's Revenge, including artwork, source code, levels in easy-to-read format, and some test projects. The meat of the original app is in `os7code`.

- In `iPhone`, you'll find an experimental project that displays levels from Murphy's Revenge.

- The `www` directory is where, perhaps someday, an HTML5 implementation of Murphy's Revenge will live.



Playing The Games
-----------------

Get SheepShaver running with MacOS9 and these games will work out of the box. If SheepShaver sound is disabled, Murphy's Revenge will not boot up.
